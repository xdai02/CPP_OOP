Internet of Things allows billions of physical objects to 
be connected to collect and exchange data for offering various 
applications, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure 
management, and home automation. On the other hand, IoT has 
unsupported features that are critical for some IoT applications, 
including smart traffic lights, home energy management and 
augmented reality. To support these features, fog computing is 
integrated into IoT to extend computing, storage and networking 
resources to the network edge. Unfortunately, it is confronted 
with various security and privacy risks, which raise serious 
concerns towards users. In this survey, we review the architecture 
and features of fog computing and study critical roles of fog 
nodes, including real-time services, transient storage, data 
dissemination and decentralized computation. We also examine 
fog-assisted IoT applications based on different roles of fog nodes.
